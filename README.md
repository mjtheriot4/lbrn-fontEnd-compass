<h1>LBRN New Website Project Front-End Development Assets</h1>
Project Overview:
This repository is used to share the front-end resources for the currently "under construction" Louisiana Biomedical Research Network website (new as of Summer 2017).

<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
<p>All deliverables are to be rendered in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. That said, the project takes advantage of a number of frameworks to render these deliverables quickly.
</p><p>
<a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a> is a CSS pre-processor that enhances the functionality of CSS. All production styling is written in SASS (using the .scss extension).
</p><p>
In addition to SASS, this project uses a sass framework called <a href="http://compass-style.org">Compass</a>. Compass is also being extended using two compass plug-ins: <a href="http://susy.oddbird.net">Susy</a>, which allows for the creation of flexible grids, and <a href="http://breakpoint-sass.com">Breakpoint</a>, which handles media queries more gracefully.
</p><p>  
Scripting includes <a href="https://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, which is linked into the pages using a CDN.
</p>
